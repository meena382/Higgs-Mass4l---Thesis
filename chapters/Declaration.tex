                        This is to certify that this MPhil thesis with title \textbf{Measurement of signal strength modifier $\mu$ of the Higgs boson decaying in four-lepton final state in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV} submitted by  \textbf{Meena Nadeem} is accepted by the Department of Physics, \textbf{Quaid-I-Azam University}. This is further certified that the work embodied in this thesis has not been submitted for any other degree.\\
                        I, Meena Nadeem, student of Quaid-i-Azam University, Department of Physics hereby declare the data used for the thesis titled “Measurement of Signal Strength Modifier μ decaying to four lepton final state in pp collision at √s = 13 TeV” is taken from CERN EOS storage system using my primary computing account.\\
Furthermore, the codes and scripts are sole property of my co-supervisor Dr. Bilal Kiani based at CERN/INFN, which were drafted for his PhD work and obtained through releasing CMSSW software through GitHib and GitLab libraries. My task was to modify the scripts and run them for signals corresponding to Higgs invariant mass and irreducible backgrounds. \\
The Signal Strength Modifier calculated and illustrated in this thesis are my review work of CMS collaboration published in paper “Higgs properties measurements using the four lepton decay channel” arXiv:1710.03577 and arXiv:2103.04956v2.\\
